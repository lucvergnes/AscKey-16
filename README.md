# AscKey-16
A fairly simple, but effective way of obfuscating text. It produces an output and a key. Only a combination of the too will result in the original text. Use this obfuscator now on: http://www.memeplaza.tk/asckey/index.html

Use:
Use Encode(string); to get an array with [output,key]. (returns array)
Use Decode(string,key); to decode the message with the key. (returns string)

You can use this on your own website or in your own project. Feel free to send me an email 
with questions or ideas 'who contibute to the project.
